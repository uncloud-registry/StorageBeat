# StorageBeat: Towards an evaluation framework for decentralised storage

**TL;DR.** We introduce the beginnings of a framework for systematically evaluating decentralised storage platforms against one another and against traditional, centralised cloud storage services. We introduce summary metrics and methodology for performance measurements, costs, and risk assessments associated with different types of solution, and present a sample application of the framework in a web frontend modelled after L2Beat and WalletBeat. 

## Background

Decentralised storage is a technology to outsource the task of data hosting to a peer to peer network of service providers (SPs). Its core offerings are blockchain based payment and storage contract management, cryptographically verifiable service, and provider diversification. This makes it a natural choice for hosting data associated to Ethereum applications. 

The decentralised storage landscape is highly fragmented, and community understanding of the offerings and tradeoffs remains patchy. Confusion about what services and guarantees are actually provided by existing decentralised storage infrastructure seems to be widespread. The most well-known services target only niche use cases such as "permanent" storage, publishing rollup blocks, or archival. While low-resource, high value applications like AMMs can afford to use the expensive, highly redundant storage of chain state, nearly all other applications will need to consider lower cost alternatives. However, most off-chain decentralised storage services do not currently have a strong offering for mutable "hot" storage. On the other extreme, the common alternative of delegating data hosting responsibility to a company offering pinning services over the IPFS protocol feels like a centralised cop-out.

We believe that the Ethereum ecosystem would benefit from a common language and systematic methodology for measuring and comparing the features of different decentralised storage systems, both with each other and with their centralised antecedents. In this post, we introduce the elements of such a framework, which we call **StorageBeat**, focusing particularly on the points of departure between decentralised and centralised options. We discuss costs, performance, and risks the prospective customer must consider when deciding which service to use. Our target audience is a sophisticated user (e.g. IT lead of a web3 or web3-curious company) evaluating storage backends to support higher level services such as a software registry or CMDB.

To illustrate how such elements can be used in practice, we've gathered data on a selection of representative services and published them as a static website: https://bafybeif42n2bg2kevqmkzoctaiwmocryrbuw6qbwnzcty2m67bxm4xoyh4.ipfs.dweb.link/. More in-depth exposition and technical details on each element can be found in the notes directory of our GitHub repository: https://github.com/uncloud-registry/StorageBeat/tree/main/notes

## Costs

Costs of using a storage service can be roughly divided into explicit costs, which are prices quoted by the service provider, and implicit, which are additional costs incurred by the customer's use of the service. For this version of StorageBeat, we consider only explicit prices.

Our objective is to be able to compare prices for services from a disparate playing field: distributed ecosystems, centralized storage providers, blockchains, and so on. The methods of quoting prices and structuring payments are correspondingly diverse, complicating any attempt at direct comparison. Usage-based pricing systems mean the customer must forecast their data storage and transit needs in order to estimate costs. Prices for decentralised services must somehow be aggregated from their diverse network of providers. Here, we discuss some of the dimensions on which pricing schemes are heterogeneous.

**Fixed and usage-based pricing.** Subscription prices can be fixed, in which case the usage allowance forms part of the service definition and the price is quoted in units of [currency]/[time], or usage-based. 

Other services quote a price for each resource. Typical resource fees are **capacity rents**, charged for maintaining data at rest and quoted in units of [currency]/[capacity]•[time], e.g. $/GiB•mo, and **egress fees**, charged for retrieving data from the service and quoted in units of [currency]/[capacity]. All of the decentralised storage services we have seen quote capacity rents; a few also allow for egress (or *retrieval*) fees.

**Banded Pricing**. Many tradcloud services charge for resource usage in a **banded** system.  For example, a client may pay nothing for the first $100$GiB of egress and a fixed rate $p$ per GiB for subsequent usage. Exotic variants also exist: for example, Backblaze calculates its bands in fixed proportion to the amount of capacity used. We don't know any examples of banded price quotes in decentralised storage.

**Marketplaces.** In some decentralised ecosystems, notably Filecoin and Sia, each peer must quote competitive prices for capacity and egress. It is therefore not meaningful to talk of "the price" of Filecoin and Sia storage, though it can still be useful to summarise the marketplace with various market price constructions.

**Permanent storage.** Some storage services quote a single upfront payment for "permanent" or "lifetime" data storage, with the latter term appearing in tradcloud and the former appearing on decentralised platforms. Compared to tradcloud, such quotes seem to be more common in decentralised storage. The price of such a service is expressed in units of [currency]/[capacity]. For the purposes of comparison with services priced in terms of capacity rent, this upfront payment must be amortised to give quantities in the usual units of [currency]/[capacity]•[time]. In StorageBeat, we use a straight line method to amortise and give a **normalised capacity rent** for lifetime contracts. More generally, clients with concrete use cases should amortise over the period of expected usage of the service.[^risk]

[^risk]: Long-term arrangements like these are particularly exposed to the risk of provider failure. See [Risk](#Risk).

**Prepayment.** In tradcloud, fixed capacity services such as Dropbox may charge at the beginning of the billing period. Prepayment also invariably happens up front in decentralised services, arguably for similar trust reasons to its use in DeFi which depends heavily on escrows. On the other hand, elastic tradcloud services with usage-based pricing schemes necessarily take payments at the end of the billing period.





## Performance

Performance of storage services is assessed by running benchmarking experiments based on workloads of the type the benchmarker expects to be using in his application. The purpose of benchmarking is generally to predict whether performance will meet requirements, and possibly to optimise a cost-performance tradeoff.

Most of the basic considerations in benchmarking decentralised services are the same as for traditional cloud. It is beyond the scope of this post to discuss the many dimensions of cloud benchmark design and implementation.[^benchmark-book] Instead, apart from a comment on nondeterminism we simply describe the statistics we have chosen for StorageBeat. For further details of the rationale we developed for our experiments, see [`./perf/README.md`](https://github.com/uncloud-registry/StorageBeat/blob/main/perf/README.md).

[^benchmark-book]: For a textbook treatment of the subject, see https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-55483-9

While **nondeterminism** in the state of external systems is already an issue for tradcloud services, there are reasons to expect qualitative differences in the shapes of distributions of performance metrics in decentralised storage. First, in principle, the provider diversification offered by decentralised storage systems should help reduce variance in performance measurements. On the other hand, the lower barrier to entry in decentralised storage markets probably means the variability for each individual provider is much higher than tradcloud hyperscalers. In practice, we observe higher variance in measurements of the less mature decentralised storage platforms.

Since tracking and reporting performance across many workloads and control scenarios is rather complex, for publicly communicating performance measurements it is helpful to quote simple summary statistics. In the StorageBeat website we have quoted estimates of expected **latency** (a.k.a. time to first byte) and **steady state throughput**[^sst-def] (SST). For reasons of benchmark portability, we estimate these as the request completion time for a very small file and the mean download speed of a request for a large file, respectively.

The **error rate** and **timeout rate** (given a fixed time limit) are both important and easy-to-understand measures of availability. For traditional cloud service providers, error code rate limits (specifically server-side HTTP 5xx codes) are usually guaranteed by an SLA which offers account credits as compensation if limits are exceeded. We haven't yet begun systematically measuring these rates on StorageBeat.

In future work, we also aim to introduce systematic measurements of client-side resource usage.

In our experiments, we used the open-source tool [Artillery](https://github.com/artilleryio/artillery) to collect request completion times for different workloads. More details are available in our GitHub repo under the [`perf/`](https://github.com/uncloud-registry/StorageBeat/tree/main/perf) directory.

## Risk

Each storage service is associated with a set of risks that something will impair our use of the service or increase our costs in the future. Weighing up these risks is part of the job of selecting which service to use. Part of the job of StorageBeat, then, is to build out a risk framework for storage services. Since risk analysis requires us to consider not only what service ought to be delivered, but also all the reasons that it might not, this risk framework actually comprises the bulk of the task.

Since the core offering of decentralised storage is the ability to mitigate counterparty risks through **provider diversification**, a good risk framework is particularly essential to communicating its selling points vis-à-vis tradcloud storage.

We attempt a rough classification of risks, risk measurement, and mitigation strategies in centralised and decentralised storage services.  In terms of the functioning of the storage service itself, we must consider the following questions:

* Will I be able to use the service in the future?
* Will the service function correctly in the future?
* If the service no longer suits my needs in the future, how easily can I migrate?

### Availability

If we aren't able to use the service, the service is *unavailable.* Unavailability can be local to the data being requested, or global in that it affects the entire service. It can also be temporary or permanent.

The risk of global outages can be mitigated in the following ways:

- **SLA.** A service-level agreement provides a definition of the service and often an indemnity for some type of service failure. Tradcloud services typically offer compensation for an *error rate* exceeding a certain limit, e.g. 99% in a five minute window.[^s3-sla][^sla.md] On the flip side, Filecoin customers may be compensated in the event of a durability failure in the form of early termination of a storage contract.
  In StorageBeat we report whether we could find an SLA, whether it carries an indemnity, and summarise what is covered.

- **Survival analysis.** Global, permanent outages arise when a service provider ceases operations. To mitigate this, estimate the survival probability of each service provider over the desired service period and allocate to providers with better scores.

- **Diversification** of service providers. 

  * *Backend diversity.* When data is split and distributed among multiple backend storage providers, the risk of correlated failure is reduced. The effect is stronger when providers are diverse along multiple axes (jurisdiction, locality, technology, corporate structure, etc.).
  * *Gateway diversity.* A single backend service can often be accessed through multiple gateways without the need for replicating capacity rental; gateway diversification can therefore be a cost-effective route to risk reduction. For example, one can access many decentralised storage services through a third party web gateway for convenience, but in case such is not available, the p2p network is available as a fallback. The p2p network may also itself be considered a diversified network of gateways.

  We don't have a simple numerical measure that captures diversification, but measuring the entropy of some "market share" distribution — such as capacity share per provider — can give a preliminary indication.[^provider.md]
  
[^provider.md]: See also [`./notes/risk/provider.md`](https://github.com/uncloud-registry/StorageBeat/blob/main/notes/risk/provider.md).

We turn now to the risk of specific data loss, or **durability** risks.[^durability.md]

[^durability.md]: See also [`./notes/risk/durability.md`](https://github.com/uncloud-registry/StorageBeat/blob/main/notes/risk/durability.md).

* **Storage proofs.** A typical feature of web3 storage systems is that a system of cryptographic proofs provides some assurance that data remains available to the service provider at the time the proof is constructed. Attaching explicit incentives to storage proof publication is supposed to cultivate a population of providers who make efforts to retain access to client data in the future so that they may claim these incentives. Incentives may be in the form of revenue or the threat of collateral seizure, a.k.a. *slashing*.
  In the StorageBeat website we simply report the developers' own name for the storage proof system each service uses. In future, it would be more useful to develop a detailed comparison framework that clarifies the risk vectors from a user-centric perspective.
* **Durability reporting.** Storage services ought to essentially never lose data. It can therefore be challenging to put a credible number to object loss rate on reasonably stable services. Tradcloud services report durability on the "nines" basis, where object loss rate per year is bounded by a power of ten. Though the basic methodology to achieve these numbers is documented,[^backblaze] such reports are not usually backed up by evidence or legal guarantees.[^hetzner-durability] 
  In decentralised cloud, the global rate of node failure or data loss can be observed by tracking missed storage proofs. The tradcloud methodology could then be applied to extrapolate the observed rate to a formal probability of losing a replicated or otherwise expanded object distributed over the node population.[^codex] As of yet we haven't carried out any such calculations.

### Correctness

The question of *correct functioning* depends heavily on the details of the service definition.  Some basic expectations are as follows:

* Successfully uploaded content will be available for download for the extent of the contract duration.
* Retrieved content wil be "correct," where for a distributed system correctness is defined by a database *consistency model*. There are various consistency models arising in practice in decentralised storage:
  * For **immutable** storage, consistency simply means that the data retrieved under an address is exactly what was uploaded. In practice, this consistency can be validated with a content commitment (checksum, hash). If storage is **content-addressed**, as is often the case for decentralised storage, then the validation of such commitments is built in to the basic infrastructure.
  * Tradcloud storage offerings typically offer **strong** consistency, which guarantees that retrieved data always reflects the *most recent* update, where recency is understood according to some globally (within the service) defined ordering.
  * Blockchain state, or other decentralised mutable storage offerings such as Swarm feeds, offers a more exotic consistency model that depends on the mechanism by which the system settles on transaction inclusion and ordering. Finding ways to report the consistency properties of such systems is an open area of research.
* There will be no unauthorised access to the services (for example, third parties viewing the data). A major part of this is **privacy**, which pertains not only to unauthorised reads but also to leaking information about authorised usage. Though there is undoubtedly much to say on this subject, we have not investigated it deeply.

### Generic service risk categories

Considerations within these categories apply to all decentralised services, not only storage. As such, they are already familiar to users of blockchain services.

* **Counterparty risk.** With centralised services, all risks are counterparty risks. Cryptoeconomic incentives, smart contract enforcement, and counterparty diversification allow many counterparty risks to be mitigated on decentralised platforms.
* **Contract risk.** Risk that the terms of the agreement will not be respected or enforced, or that customer expectations do not reflect the enforced terms. For centralised services, they are counterparty risks. For decentralised services, they may be replaced with *smart contract risk*, which is a risk of incorrect implementation of the contract semantics.
* **Financial risk.** This includes **price risk** and **currency risk**. In decentralised services, both service price and, if fees are priced in a volatile asset, exchange rate is often highly volatile. In the case of sharp price rises, it may be no longer viable to continue with the contracted service, incurring a migration penalty. Similarly, if the fee asset is volatile, the client may need to maintain a balance of the asset as a hedge against future price rises, incurring a currency risk penalty. The *volatility* of these series is an easily reported metric for price and currency risks.

## What now?

We have listed elements of costs, performance, and risk analysis pertinent to the evaluation of storage services. For most of these elements, we have barely scratched the surface of how they can be analysed, presented, and used in decision making. 

* For teams that build or want to build with off-chain storage — what do you need to know? What's missing? What resources have you used to gather information?
* For teams building decentralised storage systems — let's work together to further refine these metrics, develop measurement methodologies, and forge a common language.
* What we'd like to see: more hybrid models! Centralised cloud services that provide storage proofs! Decentralised platforms with an availability SLA and (something approaching) strong consistency for mutable data!
* Topics for future research:
  * Research ways to measure provider diversity through clustering and geolocation techniques. Encourage larger scale operators to voluntarily declare their addresses in the name of transparency.
  * Develop durability model and carry out systematic measurements of durability on decentralised systems for which it makes sense.
  * More work is needed on consistency, authorisation, and privacy, which we have barely addressed. If you are an expert in one of these fields, please reach out so we can work together to enhance our models.
