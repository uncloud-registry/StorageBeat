## Performance Metrics

* **100M (KiB/s).** Mean download speed of a 100MiB workload, reported at 50th quantile. An estimator of *steady state throughput.*
  
  *For cost reasons we didn't carry out this experiment for Arweave.*

* **100K (ms).** Total session time of a 100KiB workload, reported at 50th, 95th, and 99th quantiles. An estimator of *latency* a.k.a. *time to first byte.*

## Risks

* **Consistency model.** Database consistency model. One of *immutable*, *strong*, or *exotic/blockchain*.
