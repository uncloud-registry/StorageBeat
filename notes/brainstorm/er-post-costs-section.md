## Costs

### Background on costs

It is not meaningful to attempt to linearly rank service providers across the board on some cost parameter. Service providers will tend to cluster at corners of a Pareto boundary curve; and likewise the addressable market will similarly be segmented accordingly. (This is a standard phenomenon in economic game theory. [^gt]) Simply put, market dynamics tends to polarize both providers and customers around extreme trade-offs.

That said, it is meaningful to discuss the economics of storage ecosystems. In such ecosystems there are storage providers (SPs) and storage consumers (SCs). Storage consumers engage in a type of rental contract for capacity on some storage fabric. That is, SCs pay SPs to hold data. But moreover, customers are often (interested in) paying for the ability to *correctly* retrieve their data within a timeframe which is meaningful or useful to them. On the supply side, costs are driven by the cost of storage media, bandwidth, data centre real-estate markets, labour and electricity prices, to name a few exogenous variables. Storage ecosystems compete with each other to provide services to the addressable consumer storage market, which itself is highly segmented:

* **Glacial.** Immutable data stored for immensely long periods of time (e.g., on the order of decades)

  Examples: Filecoin, Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes

* **CDN-like**. Customers who store low-to-high frequency mutated content, but wish to have both low latency and high-bandwidth with only little dependence on geolocation of the requesters

  Examples:  Wix, Amazon S3 + CloudFront, Akamai, Arweave

* **Online Filesync**. Dropbox-like, high availability + high mutability/consistency, not much weighting on bandwidth or geolocation issues. Access Control Lists (ACLs) provided permissioned access to content is important to this user-base.

  Examples: Dropbox itself, Storj

On the consumption side, SCs can expect to evaluate costs (e.g., \$/GB-mo) for capacity rental, costs for egress (\$/GB-mo), as well as perceptions of data durability disciplines at the provider. 

It is common across both startup tradcloud providers and startup web3 decentralized storage ecosystems to introduce exceptionally low rates for storage (e.g., sometimes even grandfathering in early adopters for free [^db]), especially when compared to future. It is relevant to discuss this because as nascent providers come online, StorageBeat might report alluring temporary prices for this services. A simplified profit model regarding the economics of this is

$ {\rm Profit}_{\rm total}(k) = \textrm{(grandfathered losses)}(k) + \sum_{\tau \in \rm tiers} \mathrm{profit}_\tau(k)$ 

where as epoch (e.g., say year) $k$ grows the losses are either dwarfed by the profits from new tears and/or the grandfathered losses wither away, e.g, by early adopters leaving the system. Subsidies are first introduced into the systems from early investors (e.g. IPOs / ICOs) and some level of financial and actuarial sophistication is used to forecast the usage of the system in a way that profits eventually outweigh operating costs. 

In decentralized ecosystems, a word can be said about the difference in the way the subsidies are consumed. In the decentralized world quite often storage ecosystems (and any ecosystem in general) offers node operator (NO) programs, where DevOps complexities are managed by cohort consultations and free information sharing amongst node operators, as well as consumption of subsidies for running costs, offsetting what might be unsatisfactory mining rewards.

One important part of the current work was determining how to compare the following three types of services:

* Tradcloud storage providers
* Hybrid corporate + decentralized endeavor
* Finite duration decentralized storage ecosystems
* Quasi-permanent decentralised systorage ecosystems (ie systems which purport to have infinite duration storage)

There are a number of things that can be done to compare apples-to-apples in order to make sense of purportedly quasi-permanent data storage claims. Ignoring future discounted cash flows we compute an effective perceived market length (in number of service epochs) $N_{\rm eff}$ and effective prices $p_{\rm eff}$ in the subsequent sections.

### Egress

It is the norm in tradcloud situations that enterprise customers must think seriously about their egress costs. All typical Big Cloud / Big Storage providers mention egress charges and/or capacities in their SLAs. In the decentralised ecosystems egress is a bit less clear. Some systems, e.g.., NKN & Swarm do discuss micropayments for providing a transport layer  to ferry packets, rewarding  those nodes who participate in the routing protocol. 

Empirically the authors have not yet seen much usage out of such systems and have little data on such micropayment services. On the other hand, when, e.g., data is stored on, say, the Swarm DHT it is typically easily retrievable and payments by the requester are not necessary for retrieval. (It should be noted, that in tradcloud scenario the requester also is not assumed to carry the burden of paying for egress.)

Nevertheless, it is pertinent to discuss egress conditions in p2p networks as well. Just like in tradcloud cases there are idiosyncratic subtleties involved but we hope to condense this material and relegate it to Performance Measurements sections and GitHub. 

Our study uses `artillery`  test-battery tool for *live* measuring of **steady-state throughput** (SST)  and **latency** (average time to download smallest datagram). These appear as columns in the StorageBeat front-end.

See Payments section below. 

### Quasi-permanence vs Finite Duration Services

Here we tackle the heart of the matter: how to compare vastly different service types. In particular we are faced with comparing finite duration service deals with those of purported infinite duration. In this note we refer to the latter deal type as **quasi-permanent**. As we discuss in the risks section, consumers are exposed to risks involving ecosystem abandonment.  (E.g., a blockchain ceasing to exist and no endpoints/gateways willing to fetch/store old blocks.) Our view is that the following method of comparison somehow bakes in some of this pessimism. This interesting topic deserves more work on its own right. Here we content ourselves simply with computing **effective epochs** and **effective prices** for quick price comparisons.

* TODO: make solid def [ah]

An immediate naïve way to compare quasi-permanence offers with finite duration deals is to consider the lifetime quoted price $p_\infty$ per datagram (e.g., 1 TB), and consider a market equivalent standard price $p_\epsilon$. Two ways to acquire a suitable $p_\epsilon$ are (1) choose an archetypal provider along with a tier, e.g., a specific Amazon tier comparable with data backend service comparable to the quasi-permanent deal in question and (2) compute the mean of the prices in a cluster similar services. (Number (2) currently requires some ad-hoc, by hand methods, however, we hope to confer transparency of the procedures in the StorageBeat front end.)

Finally to get an effective number of epochs of the service, that we hypothesize is some type of prediction computed by the market itself, we put $N_{\rm eff} = p_\infty/p_\epsilon$.  Here is an example calculation: 

For example, using method (1), at the time of writing storing 1 TB on Arweave – itself considered as high-frequency availability by the authors – is around 6350 USD, as quoted for lifetime storage in Arweave blocks. A similar high frequency availability tier at Amazon S3 for reference would currently cost 92 USD per month to store 1 TB with (mutable) data. We note this exact comparison is not perfect (in particular due to im/mutability distincitions), but is at least an illustration for how to begin comparing quasi-permanent deals with finite duration deals. In this case, we get for the effective epoch $N_{\rm eff} \approx \frac{6350}{92}$mo. $\approx$  69 mo. $\approx$ 5.75 yrs.   Regarding the StorageBeat front end, ultimately, one desires usable numbers; in particular, costs in units \$/GB-mo: we do this via the effective price quote $p_{\rm eff} = \frac{p_\infty}{{\rm size} \times N_{\rm eff}}$  and scaling units if necessary. Continuing with the Arweave example we get the effective price $p_{\rm eff}$ = 6350 USD/(1024 GB $\times$9 mo) $\approx$ .089 \$/GB-mo  

An other more sophisticated approach could be taken whereas one uses a curve fitting regression method using, e.g., \$/GB-mo $\sim \frac{1}{\rm epoch^\alpha}$  , which might somehow capture an effect that services purporting lifetime guarantees quote pricing schemes according to some power law. More work is required in this area, and likely to produce fruitful econometric results.

### Payments

* TODO: summarize into bullet points [ah]

In tradcloud services consumers typically choose a tier of their storage-sizing/mutability/egress and make fiat bank payments according to predefined pricing. Providers that provide fixed inelastic quotas typically bill at the beginning of the billing period, e.g., Dropbox. More elastic billing is also seen in the industry, e.g., Amazon bills at the end of the period depending on the amount of the resource(s) used during that cycle. In contrast, with decentralised services, and seemingly in De-Fi in general, billing invariably happens up front.

The way storage customers practically make payments and interact with various decentralized storage ecosystems specifically focusing on payments can be quite varied and differentiated from tradcloud services. For example, SCs using Swarm directly upload 4 KiB "chunks" into the system and use a `postage` contract which manages a relationship regarding chunks and payee-ownerships which enables rewards (payments) to flow down to the NO (the SPs); accounting is handled by a constellation of contracts on the Gnosis chain. Filecoin is distinct: SCs must first make a storage deal with a NO in a storage marketplace and prices will be mediated by FIL. Arweave and Celestia work by the familiar method of tipping to include a tx into a block (by paying native gas).

NB: difference services tend to use their own unique utility token. A few examples: Arweave uses AR, 
Swarm uses BZZ, and Filecoin uses FIL. (FA of the market cap of the of token gives some idea of the staying power of the service.)

==Another side of the story is IPFS, an unincentivized, altruistic addressing, discovery, and cacheing system. The prototypical work flow for enterprise users is to use pinning services, which, like tradcloud SLAs are an agreement to provide a storage quota which is attached to an IPFS addressable node, hopefully with some reasonable uptime.  Pinata, et al., behave vey much like tradcloud services and can have, in comparison to cryptographically guaranteed ecoystems, somewhat mysterious or absent guarantees. Files are then CID-fetchable on the open internet. Payments are often mediated either in trad-fiat (e.g., USD) as well as ether. (It should be noted that IPFS, as oft-claimed, does not have an in-built incentives system, e.g., offering cryptocurrency mediated rewards.)==

One thing that was not discussed here is the switching-costs or frictions between moving data between multiple competing services. We believe this to be an extremely important topic in the near future as "liquid data" provisioning services arise. 

###  Data Collection Methodology

The initial pricing data set that we collected was done by hand (without web-scrapers etc.). The initial compilation of quotes was provided graciously by Ramesh of the Swarm Foundation, and then subsequently added to by our StorageBeat team. We expect there to be errors related to elastic pricing that we haven't taken the time to sort out.
