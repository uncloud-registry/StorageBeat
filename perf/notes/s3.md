# Upload specifics
* Files are uploaded using MinIO CLI
* To avoid using authentication in temporarly public download links (valid 2 hours) are generated and used as a payload

# Download specifics
* Files are downloaded via HTTP using temprarly download links

# Notes
1. Normally downloading files requires authentication using AWS Signature Version 4 protocol. Artillery doesn't support this protocol to workaround this temporary pre-authenticated download links were used. This could insignioficantly effect time for the first byte (as normally it would include authentication step)
